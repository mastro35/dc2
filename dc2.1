.SH NAME
dc2 \- Dave's Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dc2
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdc2\fR is a simple command-line calculator that uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

Users enter numbers and operations interactively, and the calculator manages a stack-based memory model.

It is designed to be minimal, fast, and expressive for terminal usage.

.TP
Numbers
Enter any decimal (positive or negative) to push it onto the stack.
.TP

.TP
Exponential / Power
\fB^\fR, \fBpower\fR, \fBpow\fR \- Computes y raised to the power of x (y^x).
.TP
Trigonometric Functions
\fBsin\fR, \fBcos\fR, \fBtan\fR
.TP
Advanced Math
\fB!\fR (factorial), \fBsqrt\fR (square root), \fBrec\fR or \fBreciprocal\fR (1/x)
.TP
Constants
\fBpi\fR (Ï€), \fBe\fR (Euler's number)
.TP
Random
\fBrnd\fR or \fBrandom\fR \- Pushes a pseudo-random number between 0.0 and 1.0
.TP
Stack Commands
\fBd\fR (drop top value), \fBs\fR (swap top two), \fBc\fR (clear stack), \fBroll\fR or \fBcycle\fR (rotate stack)
.TP
Other Commands
\fBr\fR (redo last command), \fBh\fR (help), \fB?\fR (credits), \fBq\fR (quit)

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Push two numbers and add them:
.EX
> 3
> 4
> +
.EE
.PP
Compute square root of a result:
.EX
> sqrt
.EE

.SH INTERFACE
Each command is typed followed by ENTER. The interface displays the current stack after each operation.
